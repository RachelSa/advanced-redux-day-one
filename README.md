# Advanced Redux Day One

## Specialization - What to Expect

 - Meet Thursday, Friday, Monday Tuesday 9:00-10:30
 - One or two people will report on a topic
 - Group discussion
 - Prep/reading for next day
 
 ## How to present
 - Each redux club member choses a topic to report out to classmates. This means each presenter will read provided learn.co readme and linked bloged post for their topic, as well as any other blog posts or documentation they find on their own. (Plan to spend a few hours reading and preparing.)
 - When presenting, be sure to explain the topic in broad terms, defining any terminology or concepts encountered, and in specific terms (how it is implemented). The presentations can be informal and interactive. You don't need to be an expert or have everything figured out!
 - The presentation to classmates can include examples from presenter's own project or show code examples from documentation or blogs.
 - As a presenter, discuss questions encountered during research, or problems with implementations, as well as the advantages (and possible disadvantages) of the approach.
