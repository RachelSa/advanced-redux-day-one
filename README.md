# Advanced Redux Day One

## Specialization - What to Expect

 - Meet Thursday, Friday, Monday Tuesday 9:00-10:30
 - Each redux club member choses a topic to report out to classmates. This means each presenter will read provided learn.co readme and linked bloged post for their topic, as well as any other blog posts or documentation they find on their own. Be sure to explain the topic in broad terms, defining any terminology or concepts encountered, and in specific terms (how it is implemented). The presentation to classmates can include examples from their own project or other's code, discussing questions the presenter encountered during research, or problems with implementations, as well as the advantages (and possible disadvantages) of the approach. The presentations can be informal and interactive.
